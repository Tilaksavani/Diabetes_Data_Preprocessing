# Diabetes_Data_Preprocessing

This repository contains scripts for preprocessing the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset, commonly used for machine learning tasks related to diabetes prediction.

### Description

The Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset consists of various health-related features for Pima Indian women, along with a binary label indicating the presence or absence of diabetes. This preprocessing script aims to clean, transform, and prepare the data for further analysis and model building.

### Features

The dataset includes the following features:

* Number of pregnancies
* Plasma glucose concentration at 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
* Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
* 2-hour serum insulin level (mu U/ml)
* Body mass index (BMI)
* Diabetes pedigree function
* Age (years)
* Outcome (0 = not diabetic, 1 = diabetic)

### Preprocessing Steps

The script performs the following preprocessing steps:

* **Missing Value Imputation:** Handles missing values (if any) using appropriate techniques like mean/median imputation or more advanced methods.
* **Outlier Detection and Treatment:** Identifies and addresses outliers using methods like z-score or IQR (Interquartile Range).
* **Data Normalization:** Scales the features to a common range (e.g., standard scaler, min-max scaler) to ensure they contribute equally during model training.
* **Label Encoding (if necessary):** Converts categorical labels (if present) to numerical values for machine learning algorithms that require numerical features.
* **Data Splitting:** Splits the preprocessed data into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

**Note:** The specific techniques used for each step might be adjusted based on data exploration and analysis.

### Dependencies

The script may require specific Python libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing. You can find these dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file (if provided) or install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install <library_name>
```

### Usage

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies (if applicable).
3. Run the preprocessing script:

```bash
python preprocess_diabetes_data.py
```

This will generate preprocessed data files (e.g., training and testing sets) that can be used for further analysis and machine learning modeling.
